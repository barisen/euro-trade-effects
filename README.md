Empirical analysis of the euro’s trade effects using CEPII gravity data and PPML.

## The Trade Effects of the Euro: A Case Study of Germany and the Netherlands

This repository contains the data preparation, econometric estimation, and robustness checks associated with our term paper:
“The Trade Effects of the Euro: A Case Study of Germany’s and the Netherlands’ Trade Balances.”

The paper was prepared as part of the course Germany's Foreign Trade 1870–Today (SoSe 2025) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Nikolaus Wolf.

The project applies modern structural gravity modeling techniques (PPML with 3-way fixed effects) to investigate the heterogeneous trade effects of the euro. We focus particularly on Germany and the Netherlands, while also considering Greece and Italy for contrast.
